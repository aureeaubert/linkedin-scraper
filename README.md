# LinkedIn scraper

## How to use it

```bash
npm run scrape-profile-usernames.js <session cookie> <search url>
npm run scrape-profiles.js <session cookie> # must be launch at spaced times due to rate limiting
```

*Note: `session cookie` corresponds to the LinkedIn authentication cookie named `li_at`*
